# README for `generateVector` Function

## Description

The `generateVector` function is a Python function that uses pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to provide a vector representation for an input word. The GloVe word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and are useful for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `generateVector` function, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Gensim library (>= 4.0.0) (`pip install gensim`)

## Instructions

1. **Download the GloVe Pre-trained Word Embeddings**

   The GloVe word embeddings can be downloaded from the Stanford NLP group's website. Follow these steps:

   - Go to the GloVe project page: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
   - Look for the appropriate GloVe version based on the dimensionality you need (e.g., 50, 100, 200, or 300).
   - Click on the download link corresponding to the dimension you want.
   - Save the downloaded GloVe txt file to a suitable location on your local machine.

2. **Use the `generateVector` Function**

   The `generateVector` function takes a word as input and returns its vector representation using the loaded GloVe word embeddings.

   - Import the necessary libraries and functions in your Python script:

     ```python
     from gensim.models import KeyedVectors
     ```

   - Define the path to the downloaded GloVe txt file in the `generateVector` function:

     ```python
     def generateVector(word):
         glove_file = 'path_to_downloaded_glove_file.txt'
         # Rest of the function implementation
         # ...
     ```

   - Insert the path to the GloVe txt file in the `glove_file` variable inside the function.

   - Call the `generateVector` function with the word for which you want to obtain the vector representation:

     ```python
     word_to_embed = 'your_word_here'
     vector = generateVector(word_to_embed)
     print(vector)
     ```

   - The `vector` variable will contain the vector representation of the input word.

## Notes

- If you encounter any issues with loading the GloVe txt file, make sure it is in the correct format. The function expects the file to be in the word2vec format.
- Ensure that you have enough disk space available to store the GloVe txt file, as it can be relatively large depending on the chosen dimensionality.
